# Investigation of Propeller-Induced Tip Vortices Using Particle Image Velocimetry - Course Project - AM5090
This repository contains information on my course project on the course AM5090 - Flow Visualization Techniques at IIT Madras. The project was focussed on performing a desktop scale PIV experiment with rotating propellers to compare the vortices due to a two-bladed and a three-bladed propeller.
